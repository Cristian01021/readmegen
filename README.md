# README Generator
## Description
The project is a JavaScript-based command line application built with Node.js to assist in generating a README file for your project.

## Usage

To begin, clone the repository to your machine. 

Now, navigate to the project in the command line.

Enter the following command to install the needed packages to run the application ``` npm i ```

Now run the application by entering the command ``` node index.js ```

By cycling through a sequence of questions, the application prompts you to provide relevant details or select the appropriate option. Simply enter the necessary information or choose the correct option and press enter to proceed to the subsequent question.

Once the process is finished, the console will display the message "Success," indicating that your README file is now accessible. The file, named customREADME.md, will be saved for future reference.
